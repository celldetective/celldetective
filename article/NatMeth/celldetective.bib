  abstract = {Background: Time-lapse microscopy imaging is a key approach for an increasing number of biological and biomedical studies to observe the dynamic behavior of cells over time which helps quantify important data, such as the number of cells and their sizes, shapes, and dynamic interactions across time. Label-free imaging is an essential strategy for such studies as it ensures that native cell behavior remains uninfluenced by the recording process. Computer vision and machine/deep learning approaches have made significant progress in this area. Methods: In this review, we present an overview of methods, software, data, and evaluation metrics for the automatic analysis of label-free microscopy imaging. We aim to provide the interested reader with a unique source of information, with links for further detailed information. Results: We review the most recent methods for cell segmentation, event detection, and tracking. Moreover, we provide lists of publicly available software and datasets. Finally, we summarize the metrics most frequently adopted for evaluating the methods under exam. Conclusions: We provide hints on open challenges and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Pretrained neural network models for biological segmentation can provide good out-of-the-box results for many image types. However, such models do not allow users to adapt the segmentation style to their specific needs and can perform suboptimally for test images that are very different from the training images. Here we introduce Cellpose 2.0, a new package that includes an ensemble of diverse pretrained models as well as a human-in-the-loop pipeline for rapid prototyping of new custom models. We show that models pretrained on the Cellpose dataset can be fine-tuned with only 500\textendash 1,000 user-annotated regions of interest (ROI) to perform nearly as well as models trained on entire datasets with up to 200,000 ROI. A human-in-the-loop approach further reduced the required user annotation to 100\textendash 200 ROI, while maintaining high-quality segmentations. We provide software tools such as an annotation graphical user interface, a model zoo and a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the adoption of Cellpose 2.0.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} High-throughput live-cell imaging is a powerful tool to study dynamic cellular processes in single cells but creates a bottleneck at the stage of data analysis, due to the large amount of data generated and limitations of analytical pipelines. Recent progress on deep learning dramatically improved cell segmentation and tracking. Nev-ertheless, manual data validation and correction is typically still required and tools spanning the complete range of image analysis are still needed. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We present Cell-ACDC, an open-source user-friendly GUI-based framework written in Python, for segmenta-tion, tracking and cell cycle annotations. We included state-of-the-art deep learning models for single-cell segmenta-tion of mammalian and yeast cells alongside cell tracking methods and an intuitive, semi-automated workflow for cell cycle annotation of single cells. Using Cell-ACDC, we found that mTOR activity in hematopoietic stem cells is largely independent of cell volume. By contrast, smaller cells exhibit higher p38 activity, consistent with a role of p38 in regula-tion of cell size. Additionally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, histone Htb1 concentrations decrease with replicative age. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Cell-ACDC provides a framework for the application of state-of-the-art deep learning models to the analysis of live cell imaging data without programming knowledge. Furthermore, it allows for visualization and cor-rection of segmentation and tracking errors as well as annotation of cell cycle stages. We embedded several smart algorithms that make the correction and annotation process fast and intuitive. Finally, the open-source and modular-ized nature of Cell-ACDC will enable simple and fast integration of new deep learning-based and traditional methods for cell segmentation, tracking, and downstream image analysis.

  abstract = {Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) finding parameter-efficient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach (STARDIST-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.},
