        abstract = {A current key challenge in bioimaging is the analysis of multimodal and multidimensional data reporting dynamic interactions between diverse cell populations. We developed Celldetective, a software that integrates AI-based segmentation and tracking algorithms and automated signal analysis into a user-friendly graphical interface. It offers complete interactive visualization, annotation, and training capabilities. We demonstrate it by analyzing original experimental data of spreading immune effector cells as well as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity events using multimodal fluorescence microscopy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
