Table Explorer (Table UI)
=========================

.. _table_exploration:

The Table Explorer (internally ``TableUI``) is a powerful interface for interacting with your measurement data. It allows you to visualize data structure, perform calculations, generate plots, and aggregate track information.

Overview
--------

The Table UI provides a spreadsheet-like view of your data with extensive capabilities for data manipulation and visualization. It is accessible from various parts of the application where measurement tables are displayed.

Menu Actions
------------

The menu bar provides access to file operations, column editing, and mathematical transformations.

For a complete list of commands (including Keyboard Shortcuts), see the :ref:`Table Explorer Menu Reference <ref_table_explorer_menus>`.

Plotting
--------

The Table UI offers versatile plotting capabilities. Select columns in the table and use **File > Plot...** (``Ctrl+P``) to visualize them.

1D Plotting
~~~~~~~~~~~
If one column is selected (or no specific column), the 1D plot interface opens. It supports:

- **Distributions**: Histogram, KDE plot, ECDF plot.
- **Categorical**: Countplot, Swarm plot, Violin plot, Strip plot, Box plot, Boxenplot.
- **Stats**: Option to compute KS test p-values and Cliff's Delta effect size.
- **Grouping**: Select X, Y, and Hue variables to group data.

2D Plotting
~~~~~~~~~~~
If two columns are selected, a scatter plot is automatically generated comparing the two variables.

Time Series / Track Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When viewing track data, you can visualize signals over time:

- **Plot instantaneous...** (``Ctrl+I``): Switches the plotting mode to show track signals when rows are selected, allowing you to see the temporal evolution of metrics for selected cells.

Track Collapsing
----------------

One of the most powerful features is the ability to aggregate data at the track level. This transforms your data from a **time-series format** (one row per timepoint) to a **track-based format** (one row per cell track). Use **File > Collapse tracks...** (``Ctrl+G``) to open the projection mode dialog.

Global Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Collapse the entire track into a single value using an aggregation function.

- **Operations**: `mean`, `median`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `last`, `prod`, `sum`.
- **Example 1**: You want to know if a cell *ever* expressed a marker. Use **max** on the intensity column.
- **Example 2**: You want to correlate cell size with fate. Use **mean** on the ``area`` column to get the average size of the cell over its lifetime.

@ Event Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extract measurement values at a specific event time. This is useful for synchronizing data around biological events.

- **Prerequisite**: Your table must contain event times (columns starting with ``t_`` or ``t0``), typically generated by the *Event Detection* or *Event Annotation* modules.
- **Example**: "What was the cell's nuclear circularity **at the moment of division**?". Select ``@ t0`` (or your specific event column). The resulting table will contain the value of ``circularity`` at the frame corresponding to that event for each cell.

Per Status
~~~~~~~~~~
Aggregate measurements independently for each cell state or status.

- **Prerequisite**: Your table must contain status or classification columns (starting with ``status_`` or ``group_``).
- **Example**: Compare protein localization during the cell cycle.
    - If you have a ``status_cell_cycle`` column (with values like G1, S, G2), selecting this option with **mean** will create separate columns for each phase (e.g., ``mean_intensity_G1``, ``mean_intensity_S``).
    - You can then easily plot these against each other to see stage-specific differences.
